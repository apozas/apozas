### Hi there 👋

I'm a post-doctoral researcher in [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/mathqi) and [Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas](https://www.icmat.es). My current research focuses, mostly, in the interplays between machine learning and quantum physics, and in quantum nonlocality. In the past, I have also worked in quantum thermodynamics, and in quantum information aspects of quantum field theory.

### What you will find 👀
There are a few things that you may find wandering around here:
- Computational appendices of research papers 🖥️: It is my belief that science should be open and reproducible (and that scientists shouldn't wasting their time programming things that have already been programmed). Due to this, I always make an attempt to publishing the computer codes employed in each scientific publication I author. Examples of these computational appendices are [rapid](https://github.com/apozas/rapid), [quantum-networks-scalar-extension](https://github.com/apozas/quantum-networks-scalar-extension), [gaussianotto](https://github.com/apozas/gaussianotto), [bayesian-dl-quantum](https://gitlab.com/apozas/bayesian-dl-quantum) (this last one, in GitLab).
- Teaching material 📚: of different lectures and courses I have taught. This is the case of [teaching](https://github.com/apozas/teaching) and [BIST-Python-Bootcamp](https://github.com/apozas/BIST-Python-Bootcamp).
- Learning material 🔍: mostly in classical and quantum machine learning, developed while studying the subjects. Examples are [ml-projects](https://github.com/apozas/ml-projects), [qml-rg](https://github.com/apozas/qml-rg), and [ebm-torch](https://github.com/apozas/ebm-torch), which is a library written in Pytorch to train energy-based generative models.
- An Android app! 📱 which helped me retain sanity during 2020: [contactdiary](https://github.com/apozas/contactdiary)
